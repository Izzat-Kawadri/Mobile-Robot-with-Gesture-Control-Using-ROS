# Mobile-Robot-with-Gesture-Control-Using-ROS

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a mobile robot with two wheels controlled wirelessly using ROS (Robot Operating System). The robot is designed to receive movement commands based on hand gestures captured by a laptop camera, processed using Python with the Mediapipe library. The system can also be controlled via keyboard inputs. The project combines hardware and software components to achieve a functional robotic platform, with real-time control and interaction.

We successfully implemented the system to perform four basic movements: **forward**, **backward**, **left**, and **right**. These movements are controlled wirelessly using recognized hand gestures.

## Study and Analysis Process

</p>

We started by analyzing existing mobile robotic systems, focusing on wireless control methods and hand gesture recognition technologies. Mediapipe was chosen for its robust gesture detection. The integration of ROS allowed for efficient communication between different parts of the system, such as the ESP32, the laptop camera, and the robotâ€™s movement control. 

### Key analysis areas:
- **Wireless control**: Evaluating the most reliable methods of sending commands from a laptop to the robot.
- **Gesture recognition**: Testing different hand gestures and fine-tuning Mediapipe's capabilities.
- **Hardware integration**: Ensuring the motors, battery, and motor controller worked seamlessly with ESP32 for smooth operation.

## Implementation

</p>

1. **Hardware Assembly**: 
  - The robot's frame was constructed from a handmade structure inspired by an Arduino car model. The two DC motors were connected to the L298N motor driver, which in turn was controlled by the ESP32. The ESP32 was powered by a 12V lithium battery and received movement commands over Wi-Fi. 
2. **Software Integration**: 
<p align="center" >
  <img src="./images/nodes.png" alt="rosnodes" height="300"/>
</p>

- The ESP32 was programmed using the Arduino IDE to act as a ROS serial node, subscribing to the `cmd_vel` topic. It interpreted the velocity commands and controlled the motors accordingly.
   - A Python script using Mediapipe was developed to recognize hand gestures from the laptop camera. Detected gestures were mapped to different movement commands, which were published to the `cmd_vel` topic in ROS.
   - ROS nodes were created for Turtlesim and Teleop_Turtle to enable both simulation and keyboard control.

3. **Communication**: 

- The laptop processed hand gestures and sent movement commands via Wi-Fi to the ESP32, which controlled the robot's motors. The same commands were sent to Turtlesim for debugging and additional visualization of movement.


4. **Movement Control**:
   <p align="center" ><img src="./images/camera.png" alt="camera" height="200"/></p>
  The robot successfully responds to four hand gestures:
   - **Forward**: The robot moves forward.
   - **Backward**: The robot moves backward.
   - **Left**: The robot turns left.
   - **Right**: The robot turns right.

## Getting Started :

To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set up the software and run the robot.

### 1. Clone the Repository :
Clone the project repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Izzat-Kawadri/Mobile-Robot-with-Gesture-Control-Using-ROS.git
```

### 2. ESP32 Setup :

Navigate to the ESP32 folder for the Arduino IDE code. This code is responsible for subscribing to the `cmd_vel` topic in ROS and controlling the robot's motors.
- Open the `ESP32` folder in Arduino IDE.
- Install the required libraries (such as the ESP32 library) through the Arduino Library Manager.
- Flash the code to your ESP32 device using the appropriate COM port.
- Connect the ESP32 to the motor driver and motors as outlined in the hardware section above.

### 3. ROS Workspace Setup :

A zip file containing the ROS workspace `(catkin_ws.zip)` is provided in the repository. To use it:

 - Extract the `catkin_ws.zip` file.
 - Navigate to the extracted ROS workspace directory.
 - Build the workspace:
   
```
cd catkin_ws
catkin_make
```

- Source the workspace:
  
```
    source devel/setup.bash
```

### 4. Gesture Recognition :

The gesture recognition Python script is located in the Gesture Recognition folder. This script uses `Mediapipe` to detect hand gestures and publishes the corresponding commands to the `cmd_vel` topic.

To run the gesture recognition script:

- Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary dependencies like `mediapipe` and `opencv-python`.
- Navigate to the Gesture Recognition folder.
- Run the Python script:
  
```
    python gesture_control.py
```

This script will start capturing hand gestures through the laptop camera and publish commands for the robot.
    

### 5. Running Turtlesim for Debugging :

To simulate and visualize the robot's movement, you can use Turtlesim as an additional feature:

- Start the Turtlesim node in ROS:

```
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

- Run the teleop keyboard control node to control the robot with your keyboard (optional):

```
rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
```

## Future Improvements
1. **Improved Gesture Recognition**: Enhance the accuracy and range of gesture recognition using advanced machine learning models or custom-trained models for specific hand gestures.
2. **Obstacle Detection**: Integrate sensors such as ultrasonic or LiDAR to enable obstacle detection and autonomous navigation.
3. **Enhanced Battery Life**: Use a more efficient power management system to extend the robot's operating time.
4. **Camera Integration on the Robot**: Mount a camera on the robot itself for real-time environment detection and advanced control mechanisms like visual SLAM.
5. **Multiple Control Modes**: Add more control modes such as voice commands or smartphone app-based control.
6. **Autonomous Navigation**: Implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and autonomous decision-making algorithms to allow the robot to navigate without human input.
